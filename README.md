# rp_mgr
Create and manage resource plans for project managers

Requires Python3 and xlsxwriter

to run on the command line, run "python3 create_basic_rp_m.py". 
This will start an interactive wizard that asks a bunch of friendly questions. 
When you are done, it will export the plan to an Excel spreadheet. Right now it just includes the project code :)

Wish me luck on this!
